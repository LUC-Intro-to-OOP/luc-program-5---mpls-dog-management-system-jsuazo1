# Program 5: MPLS Dog Management System
**Programs 5 and 6 will be similar in functionality.**

The MPLS Dog Boarding company would like for you to create an application that allows for a care attendant to be able 
to create, retrieve and update dog records from the system. MPLS Dog Boarding can only have 12 dogs in their care at a time. When you select the option to **create** a dog record.  You will 
enter the dog's id, dog's name, weight and dog's age.  Once information is entered for a dog, the program will display
entered information and reprompt the care attendent to select an option to exit, display, create or update dog record.  

When the **update** option is selected the care attendant will be presented with option to enter the dog's id number and reassign information
pertaining to dog.  

When the **retrieve** option is selected, the user will be able to enter the dog's id and be presented
with dog information.

**Hints**
- Consider the use of parallel arrays to store dog Data.  **Declare your arrays at the class level and not in the main method.**
- Consider commenting your code and writing the code in the main method before modularizing the program.

Your program should operate similarly to the program shown in the .gif below The .gif below show three iterations of running the program
